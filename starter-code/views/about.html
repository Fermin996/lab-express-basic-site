    <h1>I became a dummy so that you dont have to!</h1>
    <p>
      The truth is.... dumbness is unailable. But the trick is to sound As intelligent as possible without actually knowing what youre talking about.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wear glasses, people will autoatically assume you have +10 intelligence.... like skyrim or something</li>
      <li>Hold a cup of coffee in your hands when you can. If you have coffee you appear to not be as lazy as you most probably are.</li>
      <li>Sit next to somebody uglier than you... you look better by default basically.</li>
      <li>Become vegan. Seriously. You legally can't judge a vegan</li>
    </ul>
